### Inverter VTC Characterization

Performing characterization of the voltage transfer characteristics (VTC) of an inverter with varying W/L ratios for PFET and NFET. The key parameters being measured include:

- **Threshold Voltage (Vth)**
- **Drain Current (Id)**
- **Gate Capacitance (Cg)**
- **Power Consumption (P)**
- **Propagation Delay (t_pd) (ps)**
- **Gain (Av)**
- **Input Low Voltage (vil)**
- **Output Low Voltage (vol)**
- **Noise Margin Low (nml)**
- **Output High Voltage (voh)**
- **Input High Voltage (vih)**
- **Noise Margin High (nmh)**
- **Transconductance (gm)**
- **Frequency (f)**
- **Output Resistance (Ro)**

This characterization allows me to analyze how different transistor sizing affects the inverter's performance in terms of switching behavior, speed, power efficiency, and noise margins.
